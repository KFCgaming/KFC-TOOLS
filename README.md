## 

**KFC Tools** is my **first Multitool** that I could create. It allows you to do various things.
  
##

```Ip Adress Generator```
```Discord Token Generator```
```Proxy Generator```
```Random YouTube Video```
```Random Discord Server```
```Random Bit.ly Link```
```Free Nitro```
```Windows Activator```

##

The discord token, youtube video, discord server, ip address and bit.ly link generator are randomly generated, if the results don't work, I'll try to work on a slightly more improved version for the links .
